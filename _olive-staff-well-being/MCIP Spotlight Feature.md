<h4><strong>Beatty Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>In 2024, Beatty Secondary School proudly hosted its inaugural <em>Symphony of Dreams</em> concert
in support of the President’s Challenge. Held in our school hall to keep
ticket prices accessible, the concert not only showcased the diverse talents
of our performing arts groups namely Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Concert
Band, Drama, Malay Dance, and Modern Dance, but also celebrated our school’s
spirit of giving back to the community.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>Symphony of Dreams</em> was inspired by our school’s
theme for the year, designed to bring our re-envisioned values to life,
and to empower our students to explore their giftings as encapsulated in
our tagline: <em>where your aspirations take flight</em>. Symbolically,
the <em>Symphony of Dreams</em> would be timeless, and would serve our students
and the larger community well. The overwhelming support from our School
Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, and Beatty Alumni helped us sell
all 800 tickets at $10 each, with some students even winning tickets through
assembly talks.</p>
<p>The concert, while meant to raise funds for the President’s Challenge,
also served to boost our students’ confidence and bring our community closer
together; the surprise performance by teachers certainly added a lively
touch to the concert while contributing to a meaningful cause. Mr. William
Low, a guest at the concert, had this to say, “It is inspiring and provides
an insight into the educational system today. More importantly, I see enthusiasm
and positive spirit among the performers, students, alumni, and school
staff. This is likely the result of strong leadership, especially from
teachers who have nurtured students' interest in the performing arts. Well
done and keep it up!"</p>
<p>The overwhelming success and positive response to this inaugural performance
inspire us to make it a regular feature in our school’s calendar. The concert
itself exemplifies how Beattyians can use their gifts and talents to make
a meaningful difference, and ultimately speaks to our mission of nurturing
adaptive thinkers, agile learners and active contributors.</p>
