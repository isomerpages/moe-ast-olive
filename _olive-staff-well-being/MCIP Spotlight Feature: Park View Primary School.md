<h3><strong>Park View Primary School: Cooking Up Kindness for the Community</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Park View Primary School (PVPS) has supported the MOE President's Challenge
Heart Train Campaign for the past two years and it has been an absolute
honour to be part of this meaningful fundraising activity. To contribute,
we have organised exclusive cooking class demonstrations for our dedicated
teachers and school staff, creating a fun and interactive way to bring
our community together while raising funds for 65 organisations supported
by the campaign.</p>
<p>But it was not just the teachers who joined in the fun! &nbsp;School Leaders
and support staff also participated by registering for these culinary classes,
conducted by our talented colleagues who shared their culinary expertise.
Besides registering for their choice of chef, staff donated generously
and sponsored the ingredients in the spirit of giving back. These sessions
did not just teach cooking skills – they offered a chance for professional
growth, team bonding, and plenty of laughs along the way. It was an opportunity
to develop new skills, share culinary secrets, and fostered camaraderie
among our staff, while contributing to a good cause.</p>
<p>To keep things unique and exciting, we introduced themed cooking demonstrations
each year. The first year's theme was "Whipping Up a Quick Meal," focused
on nutritious, time-saving dishes perfect for the busy lives we all lead.
Last year, we turned the spotlight on our younger colleagues with the theme
"Cooking Class Demonstrated by Young Colleagues”. It was an inspiring session
that showcased their culinary talents while promoting intergenerational
learning.</p>
<p>Above all, every single cent raised supports the MOE President's Challenge
Heart Train Campaign. We are so grateful for the unwavering enthusiasm
and generosity of our PVPS family, which made this initiative a resounding
success and left a lasting impact on our school community. Together, we
are cooking more than just meals – we are helping to build a brighter future
for those in need!</p>
