<h3><strong>Park View Primary School: Cooking Up Kindness for the Community</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Park View Primary School (PVPS) has supported the MOE President's Challenge
Heart Train Campaign for the past two years and it has been an absolute
honour to be part of this meaningful fundraising activity. To contribute,
we have organised exclusive cooking class demonstrations for our dedicated
teachers and school staff, creating a fun and interactive way to bring
our community together while raising funds for 65 organisations supported
by the campaign.</p>
<p>But it was not just the teachers who joined in the fun! &nbsp;School Leaders
and support staff also participated by registering for these culinary classes,
conducted by our talented colleagues who shared their culinary expertise.
Besides registering for their choice of chef, staff donated generously
and sponsored the ingredients in the spirit of giving back. These sessions
did not just teach cooking skills – they offered a chance for professional
growth, team bonding, and plenty of laughs along the way. It was an opportunity
to develop new skills, share culinary secrets, and fostered camaraderie
among our staff, while contributing to a good cause.</p>
<p>To keep things unique and exciting, we introduced themed cooking demonstrations
each year. The first year's theme was "Whipping Up a Quick Meal," focused
on nutritious, time-saving dishes perfect for the busy lives we all lead.
Last year, we turned the spotlight on our younger colleagues with the theme
"Cooking Class Demonstrated by Young Colleagues”. It was an inspiring session
that showcased their culinary talents while promoting intergenerational
learning.</p>
<p>Above all, every single cent raised supports the MOE President's Challenge
Heart Train Campaign. We are so grateful for the unwavering enthusiasm
and generosity of our PVPS family, which made this initiative a resounding
success and left a lasting impact on our school community. Together, we
are cooking more than just meals – we are helping to build a brighter future
for those in need!</p>

<p><strong><u>The Cooking Recollections</u></strong>
</p>
<p>After the cooking demonstration class, our staff shared delightful stories
on how they had recreated their dishes at home. Despite being simple meals,
these dishes became repeat menu items, with their families loving and enjoying
each dish.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Unexpected Feast</u></strong>
</p>
<p>What started as a cooking demonstration transformed into a lively ‘makan’
session that no one saw coming. As the cooking came to an end, the aroma
of freshly prepared dishes filled the air, and the staff couldn’t resist
the temptation to dig in all the dishes by our PVPS in-house chefs. It
was not just about the food – it was about coming together as a community
to share an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cooking with Laughter</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The cookout sessions became an unexpected highlight of the day, filled
with joy and laughter, as everyone sang along while waiting for their designated
'chef' to whip up their culinary creations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Song Dedication Magic</u></strong>
</p>
<p>What started as a fun “song dedication corner” by our very own Staff Well
Being DJ quickly evolved into something much more meaningful. The moment
transformed into a heartfelt platform for colleagues to express gratitude
for each other's hard work and support. As songs played, heartfelt and
uplifting messages filled the air. The atmosphere was filled with warmth
and gratitude, making it clear that the true melody of the day was the
camaraderie and care shared amongst the staff.</p>
