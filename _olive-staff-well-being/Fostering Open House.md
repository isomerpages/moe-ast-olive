MSF and the five Fostering Agencies, Boysâ€™ Town, Epworth Community Services, Muhammadiyah Association, PPIS and The Salvation Army will be organising a Fostering Open House on 13 July 2024 at Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, Summit 2 at Level 3. We hope that through this event, more people would be able to learn more about fostering and how foster families can make an impact in the lives of children in need.
