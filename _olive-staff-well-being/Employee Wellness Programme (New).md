<h1><strong>Well-being@Gov</strong></h1>
<p>As part of our commitment to enhancing the well-being of public officers,
the Public Service has launched Well-being@Gov, a new Employee Wellness
Programme powered by Intellect. This additional tool is designed to empower
you to take better care of yourself, providing holistic support and integrating
technology and human touch. We would like to highlight that confidentiality
is the key tenet of Well-being@Gov services. In order to maintain confidentiality,
Intellect will not reveal the identities of users who have utilised Well-being@Gov
services (e.g., counselling and coaching sessions), unless there is a clear
risk of harm or injury to the user or others.</p>
<p>With Well-being@Gov, you have access to:</p>
<p>‚óè Self-guided content, from 5-minute sessions to curated learning paths
to help you build skills, overcome challenges, and more</p>
<p>‚óè 1-to-1 coaching and counselling sessions</p>
<p>‚óè 24/7 distress helpline for the moments that need a little extra care</p>
<p>Note: Well-being@Gov is meant to complement MOE staff well-being provisions
which are customised for MOE‚Äôs profile and needs (e.g., health screening,
flu vaccination, iCARE counselling service, OLive and MESRC programmes)
and will continue to be made available to all staff.</p>
