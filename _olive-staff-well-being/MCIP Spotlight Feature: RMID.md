<h3><strong>Research and Management Information Division: Going the Distance for Charity</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The RMID Go the Distance! Challenge is an annual fundraising event organised
by the Research and Management Information Division (RMID) in support of
the President's Challenge. &nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">This month-long event, which started from 2021, combines philanthropy with fitness, encouraging RMID colleagues to step up for a good cause.</a>
</p>
<p>More than just a fundraiser, this initiative aims to build team morale,
promote health awareness, and strengthen workplace bonds. The enthusiastic
participation of our colleagues each year reflects our strong commitment
towards social responsibility and well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What began as a simple challenge (started with running) has evolved into
a diverse event that includes cycling, rock-climbing, and leisure walks.
&nbsp;Participation is straightforward: colleagues donate through the President's
Challenge platform and submit their distance logs for collation. &nbsp;To
add excitement, colleagues can issue personalised challenges with additional
pledged donations. &nbsp;Top performers receive cash vouchers, while all
participants receive a commemorative Finisher T-shirt sponsored by DRMI.</p>
