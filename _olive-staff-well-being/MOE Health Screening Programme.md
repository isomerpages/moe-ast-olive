<h3>MOE Health Screening and Flu Vaccination Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Administered by Minmed Group Pte. Ltd.</strong>
</p>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:moe_swb@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">moe_swb@moe.gov.sg</a> for
booking instructions and codes.</p>
<p>Please note that only MOE staff with Civil Service Cards will enjoy the
MOE health screening subsidies and fully subsidised flu vaccination. Do
ensure that you bring along your Civil Service Card when you attend your
health screening and/or flu vaccination appointment. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. What is offered for the MOE Health Screening and Flu Vaccination Programme?</strong>
</p>
<p>Fully subsidised basic health screening is offered to all MOE staff and
you can also opt for additional packages and tests depending on your needs.
4-in-1 [FN#1] flu vaccination is fully subsidised for MOE staff.</p>
<p>MOE is also providing health screening subsidies which can only be used
on any of the optional packages and tests offered by our appointed vendor.
For more information on the subsidies, please refer to our email to all
MOE staff dated 19 June 2023 or the Staff Welfare Fund Circular PA-15-22.</p>
<p>Any unused subsidy on the day of your health screening cannot be accumulated
or carried forward to another screening session or future years.</p>
<p>Please note that Relief/Contract staff without Civil Service Cards can
take part in the health screening exercises conducted in schools at their
own cost. The basic health screening package will be chargeable at $10.80
inclusive of GST, either payable by the individual or the school if the
school wishes to fund the health screening cost for relief/contract staff.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is it compulsory for MOE staff to utilise the health screening subsidy every year?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. The objective of the health screening subsidy is to encourage MOE
staff to take good care of your health.</p>
<p>The selection of screening tests should be made based on individual risk
factors. If you are unsure, please take reference from the Health Promotion
Boardâ€™s screening recommendations&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/screen_for_life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3. What is the Healthy Lifestyle Survey all about?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Healthy Lifestyle Survey is a ministry-wide online survey to assess
the general health and lifestyle habits and how it relates to the general
health status.</p>
<p>The results obtained from this survey will help MOE identify areas for
targeted workplace health strategies. This includes workshops and other
well-being programmes organised.</p>
<p>This survey will be conducted during your online health screening registration.</p>
<p><strong>4. How often is health screening organised for MOE staff?</strong>
</p>
<p>The MOE health screening and flu vaccination programme is organised for
all MOE officers on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is the health screening compulsory?</strong>
</p>
<p>The health screening is not compulsory. However, this exercise is a workplace
health initiative from MOE and all staff are encouraged to participate
actively to promote a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>6. Who is entitled for the health screening under MOE?</strong>
</p>
<p>All MOE officers under the direct payroll of MOE with Civil Service Cards
are entitled to the fully subsidised basic health screening and flu vaccination&nbsp;package.
MOE staff will include the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teaching Staff, i.e., EOs, MKEs, AEDs and NIE trainees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Teaching Staff, i.e., EAS</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Staff attending the health screening and/or flu vaccination programme
are required to show their <strong>Civil Service Cards</strong> for verification
purposes</p>
<p><strong>7. Can I go for health screening when I am pregnant/breastfeeding?</strong>
</p>
<p>When pregnant, you will typically be seeing your obstetrician regularly
for follow-up and antenatal care. Screening tests necessary (e.g., screening
for gestational diabetes) will typically be conducted at your O&amp;G clinic.</p>
<p>It is thus recommended that you do not undergo health screening with us
when pregnant. If you do wish to, you are encouraged to only evaluate your
lipid profile and fasting glucose.</p>
<p>Certain vaccinations may not be administered when you are pregnant. Please
check with our doctors for suitability via teleconsult&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://minmed.sg/teleconsult-doctor/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, it is acceptable to undergo health screening.
However, this should not take place in lieu of or before your post-natal
follow up with your obstetrician.</p>
<p><strong>8. Can I go for health screening when I am having my menses?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is acceptable to go for health screening when you are having your menses.
However, kindly refrain from submitting your urine specimen when you are
having your menses. It is advisable to wait till day 5 from the last day
of your menstrual cycle for better accuracy.</p>
<p>Pap smear studies should not be conducted until after day 8 of menses.</p>
<p>CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor Marker) may be falsely elevated during menses, immediately
before and immediately after menses. Aim to do the CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor
Marker) test 1 week before or after your menses.</p>
<p><strong>9. Can I go for health screening when I am feeling unwell?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are feeling unwell, please postpone your health screening as it
is an elective procedure.</p>
<p>You may email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ask@minmed.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ask@minmed.sg</a>&nbsp;to reschedule an appointment,
whether it is at your office or at Minmed Health Screeners.</p>
