<p></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; <u>What is offered for health screening exercise?&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>All MOE officers<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> are entitled to the fully subsidised <strong>basic</strong> health
screening and flu vaccination package [FN#1].</p>
<p>MOE is also providing a health screening subsidy of up to $40 per staff
per calendar year for staff aged 49 and below or up to $80 per staff per
calendar year for staff aged 50 and above (Note: The subsidy quantum is
subject to a yearly review) and can only be used on any of the optional
packages and tests offered by Minmed Group Pte. Ltd.</p>
<p>Any unused subsidy on the day of health screening cannot be accumulated
nor carried forward to another screening session or future years.</p>
<p>All packages and tests offered for the health screening exercise can be
found <strong><a href="https://minmed.sg/x/moe_health_screening/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><u>.</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-MOE staff may take part in the health screening exercises conducted
in schools at their own cost. The basic health screening package will be
chargeable at $10.80 inclusive of GST, either payable by the individual
or the school if the school wishes to fund the health screening cost for
relief/contract staff. Should an officer obtain subsidized screening when
he or she is not eligible for medical benefits, MOE will take action to
recover the full cost of the medical treatment charged to the Ministry
from the officer. &nbsp;<a href="https://minmed.sg/x/moe_health_screening/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;Is it compulsory for MOE staff to utilise the health screening subsidy every year?</u></strong> 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;No, it is not compulsory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What type of screening should I go for?</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>The selection of screening tests should be made based on age, sex, pre-existing
conditions and your last health screening date. Refer to ‘<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/screen_for_life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Screen For Life’</a> assessment
for more information on recommended additional tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>What is the Lifestyle Survey about?</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Lifestyle Survey is a ministry-wide online survey to assess
the general health and lifestyle habits of staff.</p>
<p>The results obtained from this survey will help MOE identify areas for
targeted workplace health strategies. This includes workshops and other
well-being programmes organised.</p>
<p>This survey will be conducted during online registration. <a href="https://minmed.sg/x/moe_health_screening/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>How often is health screening organised for MOE staff?</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

for all MOE officers on an annual basis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>Is the health screening compulsory?</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The health screening is not compulsory. This is an MOE workplace
health promotion initiative to promote a healthy lifestyle as early detection
of diseases can lead to better management of health and health outcomes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Who is eligible for the health screening subsidy under MOE?&nbsp;</u> </strong>
</p>

<p>(ii) Contact adjunct employees on full/part load.</p>
<p>Staff attending the health screening and/or flu vaccination programmes
are required to show their <strong>Singapore Public Service </strong>card
with MOE sticker for verification purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.  <u>Are flexi-adjunct staff or casual employees eligible for the health screening subsidy?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>No. Flexi-adjunct staff or casual employees are not eligible for the health
screening subsidy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> 9.  <u>Can Non-MOE staff sign up for the health screening and/ or flu vaccination?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. Non-MOE staff may sign up for the basic health screening at a cost
of $10.80 (including GST) and flu vaccination at $18.53 (including GST).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> 10.  <u>Can I go for health screening when I am pregnant / breastfeeding?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>When pregnant, you will typically be seeing your obstetrician regularly
for follow-up and antenatal care. Screening tests necessary (e.g. screening
for gestational diabetes) will typically be conducted at your O&amp;G clinic.</p>
<p>It is thus recommended that you do not undergo health screening with us
when pregnant. If you do wish to, you are encouraged to only evaluate your
lipid profile and fasting glucose.</p>
<p>Certain vaccinations may not be administered when you are pregnant. Please
check with our doctors for suitability via teleconsult<a href="https://minmed.sg/teleconsult-doctor/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a><strong><a href="https://minmed.sg/teleconsult-doctor/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>
<a href="https://minmed.sg/teleconsult-doctor/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">.</a>
</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, it is acceptable to undergo health screening.
However, this should not take place in lieu of or before your post natal
follow-up with your obstetrician.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp; <u>Can I go for health screening when I am having my menses? </u></strong>
</p>
<p>It is acceptable to go for health screening when you are having your menses.
However, kindly refrain from submitting your urine specimen when you are
having your menses. It is advisable to wait till day 5 from the last day
of your menstrual cycle for better accuracy.</p>
<p>Pap smear studies should not be conducted until after day 8 of menses.</p>
<p>CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor Marker) may be falsely elevated during menses, immediately
before and immediately after menses. Aim to do the CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor
Marker) test 1 week before or after your menses.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>12. <u>Can I go for health screening when I am feeling unwell?</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are feeling unwell, please postpone your health screening as it
is an elective procedure.</p>
<p>You may reschedule your appointment on the Minmed Connect app, following
the step-by-step guide or WhatsApp <a href="https://minmed.sg/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>
