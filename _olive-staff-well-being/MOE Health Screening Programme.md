**Frequently Asked Questions for MOE Health Screening and Vaccination Programme**

**1. What is offered for the health screening and flu vaccination programme?**

Fully subsidised basic health screening is offered to all MOE staff and staff can also opt for additional packages and tests depending on needs. 4-in-1[\[1\]](#_ftn1) flu vaccination is also fully subsidised for MOE staff.

MOE is also providing health screening subsidies which can only be used on any of the optional packages and tests offered by our appointed vendor. For more information on the subsidies, please refer to our email to all MOE staff dated 19 June 2023 or the Staff Welfare Fund Circular PA-15-22.

Any unused subsidy on the day of health screening cannot be accumulated nor carried forward to another screening session or future years.

All packages and tests offered for the health screening exercise can be found&nbsp;[**here**](https://minmed.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Non-Fasting-MOE-Package-Brochure-2023.pdf).

Staff not under MOE payroll will still be able to take part in the health screening exercise, however, do note that the basic screening package will be chargeable at $10.80 each inclusive of GST, either payable by individual or the school if the school wishes to fund the health screening for these staff.

**2. Is it compulsory for MOE staff to utilise the health screening subsidy every year**

No. The objective of the health screening subsidy is to encourage MOE staff to take good care of your health.

The selection of screening tests should be made based on individual risk factors. If you are unsure, please take reference from the Health Promotion Board’s screening recommendations&nbsp;[**here**](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/403/abcs_of_health_screening)**.**

**3. What is the Lifestyle Survey about?**

The Lifestyle Survey is a ministry-wide online survey to assess the general health and lifestyle habits and how it relates to the general health status.

The results obtained from this survey will help MOE identify areas for targeted workplace health strategies. This includes workshops and other well-being programmes organised.

This survey will be conducted during online registration.

**4. How often is health screening organised for MOE staff?**

The MOE health screening and flu vaccination programme is organised for all MOE officers on an annual basis.

**5. Is the health screening compulsory?**

The health screening is not compulsory. However, this exercise is a workplace health initiative from MOE and all staff are encouraged to participate actively to promote a healthy lifestyle

**6. Who will be entitled for the health screening under MOE?**

All MOE officers under the direct payroll of MOE are entitled to the fully subsidised basic health screening and flu vaccination&nbsp;package. MOE staff will include the following:

*   Teaching Staff, i.e., EOs, MKEs, AEDs and NIE trainees
*   Non-Teaching Staff, i.e., EAS

Note: Staff attending the health screening and/or flu vaccination programme are required to show their **Civil Service Card** for verification purposes

**7. Can I go for health screening when I am pregnant/breastfeeding?**

When pregnant, you will typically be seeing your obstetrician regularly for follow-up and antenatal care. Screening tests necessary (e.g., screening for gestational diabetes) will typically be conducted at your O&amp;G clinic.

It is thus recommended that you do not undergo health screening with us when pregnant. If you do wish to, you are encouraged to only evaluate your lipid profile and fasting glucose.

Certain vaccinations may not be administered when you are pregnant. Please check with our doctors for suitability via teleconsult&nbsp;[**here**](https://minmed.sg/teleconsult-doctor/).

If you are breastfeeding, it is acceptable to undergo health screening. However, this should not take place in lieu of or before your post-natal follow up with your obstetrician.

**8. Can I go for health screening when I am having my menses?**

It is acceptable to go for health screening when you are having your menses. However, kindly refrain from submitting your urine specimen when you are having your menses. It is advisable to wait till day 5 from the last day of your menstrual cycle for better accuracy.

Pap smear studies should not be conducted until after day 8 of menses.

CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor Marker) may be falsely elevated during menses, immediately before and immediately after menses. Aim to do the CA 125 (Ovarian Tumor Marker) test 1 week before or after your menses.

**9. Can I go for health screening when I am feeling unwell?**

If you are feeling unwell, please postpone your health screening as it is an elective procedure.

You may email&nbsp;[ask@minmed.sg](mailto:ask@minmed.sg)&nbsp;to reschedule an appointment, whether it is at your office or at Minmed Health Screeners.
