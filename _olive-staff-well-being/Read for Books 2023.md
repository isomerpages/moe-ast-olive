**Read for Books**

Read for Books is a charity book drive to raise awareness and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. From 1 to 31 July 2024, for every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book or equivalent will be donated to selected beneficiaries, up to a certain number of books.

**Beneficiaries**

**The WondeRead initiative** brings the library closer to children aged 7 – 17 years old from less privileged backgrounds, by providing reading opportunities through free reading materials. The initiative sees NLB working with Social Service Agencies (SSAs), such as charities and family service centres, to promote a love for reading among children. 

**kidsREAD** is a nationwide reading initiative by NLB in partnership with People’s Association, self-help groups, MOE schools and preschools and social service groups to promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among young Singaporeans, specifically children aged 4-8 years old from the less privileged families.

**Ready to READ @ NLB, Starter kit & Programmes for Babies and Toddlers**, is an initiative by NLB to reach out to parents of children aged 0 to 3 from the low-income families. This initiative provides parents with ready resources to kick-start positive reading habits with their children at home. NLB is collaborating with several organisations such as Early Childhood Development Agency (KidSTART), selected healthcare and preschool centres to provide these reading resources to them.

**Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS)** 

MINDS has been caring for Persons with Intellectual Disability (PWIDs) and their families since 1962.  Grounded in the belief that all PWIDs have innate abilities and talents, MINDS is committed to empowering them and enhancing their quality of life, while advocating for greater inclusivity for PWIDs as a nation.  

Today, MINDS is one of the largest charities in Singapore, serving more than 7,000 PWIDs and caregivers every year.   With the key focus to expand community-based services, improving the employability of PWIDS, strengthening education, and engendering inclusive community living, MINDS offers a holistic range of services and programmes across the PWIDs’ lifespan.  These include schools, employment and training development centres, home-based care services and community-based services to cater to the physical, psychological, environmental and social needs of PWIDs and their families.
