MOE Staff Well Being Unit
=========================

The Staff Well-Being (SWB) Unit promotes OLive messages across schools and MOE HQ divisions and encourages them to implement well-being strategies. We provide relevant resources, organise workshops related to Social and Physical (Health) Well-Being and help staff prepare for retirement and re-employment. To promote well-being among MOE HQ staff, we implement workplace health strategies, organise well-being talks and MOE's corporate Community Involvement Programmes.
