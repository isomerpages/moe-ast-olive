At MOE, we recognise that the well-being of our officers will directly affect their capacity and motivation for work. We believe in nurturing a workplace culture that would help our officers better manage their well-being, work and family commitments effectively. In addressing staff well-being, MOE subscribes to the OLive approach which stands for “Opportunities for&nbsp;Lives to be&nbsp;ignited with&nbsp;vitality and&nbsp;exuberance”.  

#### What is OLive?

OLive is an integrated approach to developing and enhancing staff well-being. It looks into the social, physical, intellectual, community and emotional (SPICE) development of staff so as to enable them to achieve well-being in different aspects of their lives – self, family, work, community and environment.
