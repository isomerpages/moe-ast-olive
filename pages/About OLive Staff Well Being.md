<p>At MOE, we recognise that the well-being of our officers will directly
affect their capacity and motivation for work. We believe in nurturing
a workplace culture that would help our officers better manage their well-being,
work and family commitments effectively. In addressing staff well-being,
MOE subscribes to the OLive approach which stands for “Opportunities for&nbsp;Lives
to be&nbsp;ignited with&nbsp;vitality and&nbsp;exuberance”.</p>
<h4>What is OLive?</h4>
<p>OLive is an integrated approach to developing and enhancing staff well-being.
It looks into the social, physical, intellectual, community and emotional
(SPICE) development of staff so as to enable them to achieve well-being
in different aspects of their lives – self, family, work, community and
environment.</p>
