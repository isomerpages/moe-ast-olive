Staff Well-being Team (SWB Team) plans programmes in alignment with MOE’s OLive vision and goal by providing opportunities for staff to take ownership of their well-being so as to achieve harmony in self, family, work, community and environment. To promote well-being among MOE staff, the team implements workplace health strategies and leadership commitment inspires a strong workplace health culture.

  

The team organises programmes such as OLive Fiesta, annual health screening exercises, various well-being workshops and pre-retirement courses to meet the needs of a diverse workforce that comprises staff at different stages of their lives.
