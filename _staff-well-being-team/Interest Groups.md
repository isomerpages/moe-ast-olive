Sleeping Like A SGBaby
----------------------

These days, educators are witnessing an increasing number of students who are hyperactive or incapable of sustained attention in lessons. Are you aware that such behavior is usually attributed to those who do not get sufficient and quality sleep? Ever wondered why your child is sleeping poorly? How can I get my child to learn how to fall asleep without assistance? Is it even possible for the whole family to be well-rested?&nbsp;As educators ourselves, we know and value the importance of sleep. We would like to reach out to parents and parents-to-be to understand the science behind sleep and troubleshoot their children's sleep issues through our support group.

About Us  
Hui Min is an English and F&amp;N teacher at Canberra Secondary School and is expecting her second child this May. Having struggled with infant sleep issues, an aspect often underrated and commonly misunderstood, she would like to help other struggling and sleep-deprived families adopt healthy sleep routines and achieve restorative sleep that they need.  
  
Gwen is a History and Social Studies teacher at Damai Secondary who is currently on Maternity Leave after having given birth to her second daughter. She counts herself blessed to be surrounded by a supportive community in the process of sleep training and managing her children's sleep schedules, and would love to share what she knows with fellow well meaning parents.  

  
Geraldine is a Biology teacher at Raffles Institution who is passionate about Astronomy and the affective needs of teenagers. Ever since she is back in school after NPL, she has been emphasizing about the importance of sleep to her 16YO students such that most of them have started adhering to a bedtime of not later than 10-11PM with much earlier bedtime of 9-10PM on weekends.
