**iCARE**

iCARE offers counselling services and workshops for the individual’s social, emotional and psychological growth.

The aim is to enhance staff well-being and build personal and professional capacity. 

**What is Counselling?**

Counselling at iCARE focuses on helping staff gain insights into personal as well as work-related issues in order to move on and plan for the future. We believe that with a deeper understanding of these issues and better access to one’s innate resources, an individual can lead a fulfilling professional and personal life.

**Our Guiding Principles**

Respect, Personal Choice and Adherence to Strict Confidentiality are the principles that guide counselling practice at iCARE. 

**Our Outcomes**

*   Be resilient and effective in managing professional and personal lives
*   Be effective professionals who can positively influence others
*   Acquire skills that promote personal mastery
*   Be responsible for self well-being

**iCARE Workshops**

iCARE workshops aim to build resilience and help staff acquire new skills to better manage personal and career-related matters. iCARE workshops cover a variety of topics such as enhancing relationships at work, stress management and managing difficult conversations. 

iCARE workshops are open to all MOE staff. Registration for workshops is through OPAL2.0.
