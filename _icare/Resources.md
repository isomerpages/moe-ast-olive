**3R Learning Paths**

The 3R Learning Paths is a series of MLUs that enhances individuals' social-emotional strengths through self learning and reflection. Each MLU is designed using the Relate-Review-Reflect (3R) approach to help MOE staff discover different ways of managing SE challenges at work, foster self-mastery and enrich professional experiences. While the scenarios in the MLUs are based on teachers' experiences, the resources are relevant to all MOE staff.
